# Anglo-French Union
A mod for Europa Universalis 4 called Anglo-French Union which started as a work around to a personal play through which I though would be welcome to others with the lack of simiar mods to choose from.
It is currently a heavy work in progress and with only the basic building blocks in place, although I do intend to flesh it out and add as much content to it as I can to make it feel more like a nation that could be real and part of the game and less like a temporary solution.
Anyone is more than welcome to suggest any ideas and if they really want put more direct input to the mod.

## Current Features
- Custom Ideas (Work in Progress)
- Custom Map Colour
- Custom Unit Colour
- Custom Union Flag (new flag similar to Austria-Hungary courtesy of **/u/BoreasHe**)
- Conquest based country formation (requires provinces in Scotland, England and France, and for France not to exist)
- Diplomatic based country formation (requires you to be **Great Britain**, have France in a personal union and France to control key provinces)
- Nation based event to choose capital between London and Paris with negative modifiers to the one you didn't pick. (Also an option to keep capital where it is if not Paris or London)
    - Follow up event to add positive modifiers to chosen capital

## Future Updates
- Full custom mission tree based around the potential of a unified France and Britain
- More nation based events that gives negative and positive outcomes
- Full custom mission tree based around a unified British/French Union
    - To include missions surrounding colinisation on the new world and far east
    - To include missions meddling in European affairs i.e the Holy Roman Empire

## Compatability
-Not Ironman compatible
-Not compatible with any custom nation using 'AFU' tag
- Should be compatable with any mod that doesn't modify tech (required to form country)
    - With any popular requests can work to create a compatible version with the mod(s) in question
